--- DODGY BANK ACCOUNT ---

Mmm...I spot a dodgy bank account! Let's make one!
What is my current balance?
Your account balance is 0
Let's deposit an amount of 30
Your account balance is 80
Wow! Looks like we get a reward of 50 when we deposit an amount
Let's be naughty and add rewards without depositing!
Your account balance is 230
Wow! We're rich!
Let's make a lot of money right now! Let's change the account balance directly!
Your account balance is 1000000
ðŸ˜» Weeeeee!!!!

Mmm...let's make a secure bank account!
What is my current balance?
Your account balance is 0
Let's deposit an amount of 30
Your account balance is 80
Wow! Looks like we get a reward of 50 when we deposit an amount
Let's be naughty and add rewards without depositing!
Oh no :( It looks like we can't do this - it's too secure!
Your account balance is 80
Let's make a lot of money right now! Let's change the account balance directly!
Oh no :( It looks like we can't do this - it's too secure!
Your account balance is 80
ðŸ˜¹ Well I guess that's secure!

Q2 - Look at the DodgyBankAccount, this class is not well-encapsulated. Can you note down the problems with how the class is designed, and the ways it is being misused?
1. Its member variables should be private
2. "this" in constructor is not required
3. addReward() method should be private
4.account number and reward amount should be made final

It is misused by directly calling addReward() method without depositing money and as account balance variable is public so its value was changed directly.

Q3 - Compare and contrast the DodgyBankAccount and the SecureBankAccount, how is the SecureBankAccount different to the DodgyBankAccount? How is it designed to prevent it from being misused? Are there instances of better method names for clearer abstraction?

1. By making variables as private so it cannot be accessed from outside class.
2. By making addReward() method as private so it cannot be called from outside class.
3. Also by making account number and reward amount as final so this cannot be changed once assigned a value.

Method names looks fine to me.
